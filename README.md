Intro to Javascript :-

- Javascript is a High level Programming language for building web application in a efficient way.
- Javascript works on both client side rendering as well as server side rendering,
- Node JS is the runtime environment of Javascript.
- Javascript is comes from echma script so we see the latest version of javascript in the form of echma script.
- Now we used the javascript  version 6 i.e Echmascript 6(ES6).
- In another way we called ES6 as the Vanilla Javascript.
- Javascript is mainly used for building logics or functionality of a web page.



Variable :-

- Variable is a container to store some data.
- There are three types of Variable are there in Javascript.

1. Let :-

-Let is  a type of variable which used for changing the variable name latter.
-Now these days ,most of the developers used let for changing variable value.
- Let is a block scope so  we have been using let for most  of the cases,

2. Var :-

- Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable in later stage.
- Var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the cases.
- var is function or outside scope. 

3. Const :-

- const is a type of varible where we can't change our data.
- const means constanto store some data like number,integer,etc...

Rules for creating Variable Name :-

- variable names are case sensetive i.e "a" & "A" is different.
- only Letter, Digits, Underscore, & special character is allowed.(white space is not allowed).
- only letter, underscore & special character should be 1st character only.
- reserved words cannot be a variable names.



Datatypes in JS :-

- Datatypes is an attribute associated with  a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interprit its value.
- In data types we used "typeof" operator to know that what type of data it is.
- mainly in javasscript their are 2 types of data types.


1. Primitive :-
  IN Javascript  there are 7 types of data types are present.
   1. Number :- Number are types of data types those it contain some nuumerical value.
   2. Boolean :- in boolean data types we get Boolean value like  true & false.
   3. undefined:-in undefiend data types the data  is not defined so that it will show undefiend.
   4. Null :- in this data type we get null for the value means nothing.
   5. bigInt :- in bigint we will get big integer value.
   6. string :- string is a type of data that can hold some character likes name or words.
   7. Symbol :- in symbol we will get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type.

2. Refrence or Non Primitive datatype :-
- non-primitive datatypes are the  type of data type that can hold multiple of items in a single time.
- non primitive datatypes are - object, array, function.
- objectsis a non primitive datatype which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
- mainly objects are working on (key:value) pair.
- the left hand side is our keys and right hand side arwe the values of that key.

ex. of  object:-

person = {
  "name" : "web-bocket",
  "age" : 2,
  "business" : "software",
  "carrier" : "good",
}

ex. of array :-

let arr ={1,2,3,4,5,6,9,3,2}
note - array indexing start from "0".

ex. of function :-

function great () {
  console.log("hello world");
}
Operator in Javascript :-

- operator are the key features to do some task or operate some task.
- ex. A+B
- in that given example A & B are the operands , "+" sign is our operator.
- There are 5 types of operator are their in javascript.

1. Arithmetic Operator ->(+,-,*,/,%(module),**(exponets)).
2. unary operator -> ++(increment9)
